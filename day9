//Professor McGonagall teaches transfiguration at Hogwarts. She has given Harry the task of changing himself into a cat. She explains that the trick is to analyze your own DNA and change it into the DNA of a cat. The transfigure spell can be used to pick any one character from the DNA string, remove it and insert it in the beginning. 
//Help Harry calculates minimum number of times he needs to use the spell to change himself into a cat.
